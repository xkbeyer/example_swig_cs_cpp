Example Project using SWIG
=================================
This examples shows how to use SWIG to generate the glue code for interfacing between C# and C++ code.

The SWIG command is implemented as a custom build step for the interface file Mock.i.
This call generates all the wrapper files (C# and CPP). Currently they are added 
manually to the projects.
